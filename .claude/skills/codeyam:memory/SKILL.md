# CodeYam Memory Assistant

This skill helps you generate and maintain Claude Rules (`.claude/rules/`) that provide context-specific guidance. The goal is to **document genuinely confusing aspects** of the codebase—not things Claude can figure out by reading code.

## Core Principle: Document Confusion, Not Information

**Valuable rules** capture knowledge that reading the code alone wouldn't reveal:

- Historical context (why code evolved this way)
- Hidden relationships (files that must change together)
- Gotchas that caused bugs
- Non-obvious conventions

Skip documenting things Claude can determine by reading code: function signatures, type definitions, directory structure, and common patterns.

## When to Use This Skill

- Initial setup: User asks to "set up memory" or "generate claude rules"
- Maintenance: After completing complex work where lessons should be preserved
- Review: Periodically to ensure rules are accurate and up-to-date

---

## Phase 1: Setup (First Run Only)

Check if this is the first time running memory.

### 1A. Add Documentation Section to CLAUDE.md

If CLAUDE.md doesn't contain a "When Confused / With Mistakes" section, add close to the top:

```markdown
## Continuous Documentation

As you work, think about any information that might be helpful to know in future work sessions without the user re-providing the information.

This might include

- High-level architecture for complex areas of the codebase (if not obvious)
- Specific commands that are recommended
- Debugging strategies for complex areas of the codebase (if not obvious)
- Anything confusing that is encountered in the work session

### Documenting Confusion / Mistakes

It is very important to document any tribal knowledge, complex architectural decisions, and any confusion or mistakes you encounter in Claude Rules (`.claude/rules`).
Please see `.codeyam/rules/instructions.md` for guidance.
```

### 1B. Verify Instructions File

Check that `.codeyam/rules/instructions.md` exists (it should be created during `codeyam init`). If missing, copy it from `codeyam-cli/templates/rules-instructions.md`.

### 1C. Install Pre-commit Hook

Check if the project uses Husky (`.husky/` directory exists).

**If using Husky**, append to `.husky/pre-commit`:

```bash
# CodeYam Memory Up-To-Date Check
if [ -f ".codeyam/bin/memory-hook.sh" ]; then
  .codeyam/bin/memory-hook.sh
fi
```

**If not using Husky**, create or append to `.git/hooks/pre-commit`.

Ensure `.codeyam/bin/memory-hook.sh` exists and is executable (`chmod +x`).

---

## Phase 2: Confusion Archaeology

The goal is to find areas where developers have **struggled**—not just areas that are complex. High churn alone doesn't mean confusion; we're looking for patterns that indicate something is genuinely non-obvious.

### 2A. Find Confusion Signals in Commit History

**Files with rapid successive changes** (same file, multiple commits in short windows = iteration/confusion):

```bash
# Files changed 3+ times in last month (rapid iteration signal)
git log --since="1 month ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | awk '$1 >= 3 {print}' | head -20
```

**Reverts** (definite confusion signals—someone made a change that didn't work):

```bash
git log --since="6 months ago" --oneline --grep="[Rr]evert" | head -10
```

**Correction language** (commits that fix misunderstandings):

```bash
git log --since="6 months ago" --oneline | grep -iE "(oops|forgot|actually|wrong|typo|missing|should have|meant to)" | head -15
```

**Files with multiple fix commits** (confusion hotspots):

```bash
git log --since="3 months ago" --oneline --grep="fix" -i --name-only --pretty=format: | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | awk '$1 >= 2 {print}' | head -15
```

**Long commit messages** (someone felt the need to explain—complexity that needs documentation):

```bash
git log --since="6 months ago" --format="%h %s" | awk 'length($0) > 100' | head -15
```

### 2B. Dig Into High-Confusion Files

For each file that shows confusion signals, examine its evolution:

```bash
# View the story of changes to understand what kept going wrong
git log --since="6 months ago" --oneline -- path/to/confusing-file.ts

# Read the full commit messages for context
git log --since="6 months ago" --format="%h %s%n%b" -- path/to/confusing-file.ts | head -100
```

**As you analyze, ask:**

- What was the initial implementation?
- What kept breaking or needed fixing?
- What was non-obvious about the fix?
- What knowledge would have prevented the issue?

### 2C. Find Hidden Dependencies

**Files that always change together** (may have non-obvious relationships):

```bash
# Look for file pairs that frequently appear in the same commits
git log --since="3 months ago" --name-only --pretty=format: | awk 'NF' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -30
```

When you see the same files appearing together repeatedly, investigate why they're coupled.

### 2D. Scan for Developer Notes

**TODO/FIXME/HACK comments** often mark confusion points:

```bash
grep -rn "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK\|XXX" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js" --include="*.jsx" --include="*.py" . 2>/dev/null | head -30
```

Focus on comments that explain **why** something is the way it is, not just **what** needs to be done.

### 2E. Review Existing Documentation

Read these files if they exist to understand what's already documented:

- `README.md`
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `docs/` directory

Note gaps between what's documented and the confusion signals you found.

---

## Phase 3: Distinguish Important from Confusing

Not all high-churn areas need documentation. Filter your findings:

### Skip These (High Churn but NOT Confusing)

- Lock files (`pnpm-lock.yaml`, `package-lock.json`)
- Build outputs (`dist/`, `build/`)
- Generated files (`.build-info.json`, etc.)
- Files with mechanical changes (version bumps, auto-formatting)

### Document These (High Churn AND Confusing)

- Files with multiple fix commits in short windows
- Files with reverts (someone's approach didn't work)
- Files where commit messages explain complex reasoning
- Files where the same area keeps breaking
- Files that must change together but aren't obviously related

### Confusion Scoring

Prioritize areas with stronger confusion signals:

| Signal                    | Weight | Example                           |
| ------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Reverts                   | 5      | "Revert 'Track useState sources'" |
| Correction language       | 5      | "Oops, forgot to import..."       |
| Follow-up fix within days | 5      | Fix commit 2 days after change    |
| "Workaround" or "hack"    | 3      | "Workaround for webpack issue"    |
| Long commit message       | 3      | >100 chars explaining complexity  |
| Multiple fix commits      | 2      | 3+ fixes to same file             |
| Numbered fix series       | 1      | "Analysis Fixes 4", "Fixes 5"     |

Focus your documentation efforts on areas with the highest confusion scores.

---

## Phase 4: Ask Evidence-Based Questions

Questions must reference **specific confusion evidence** you found. Don't ask generic questions about files; ask about the specific commits, patterns, or problems you discovered.

Always include "I'm not sure - please investigate" as an option so users can delegate investigation to you.

### Question Examples

**For rapid successive changes:**

> "I found 5 commits to `ScopeDataStructure.ts` in 3 weeks, including 'Fix exponential blowup' and 'scope data structure optimization'. What kept causing issues here? What would someone need to know to avoid similar problems?"
>
> Options: [Explain the pattern] [I'm not sure - please investigate]

**For reverts:**

> "Commit `a9fbd6385` reverted 'Track useState initialization sources'. Why didn't that approach work? What should be done instead?"
>
> Options: [Explain what went wrong] [I'm not sure - please investigate]

**For correction commits:**

> "Commit `31e4a3842` says 'Oops, lost an import'. What import was lost and why is it easy to miss?"
>
> Options: [Explain the gotcha] [I'm not sure - please investigate]

**For files that change together:**

> "I noticed `auth.ts` and `session.ts` are modified together in 8 commits. Is there an invariant that must be maintained between them? What would break if someone changed one without the other?"
>
> Options: [Explain the relationship] [I'm not sure - please investigate]

**For long explanatory commits:**

> "Commit `abc123` has a detailed message about 'why we need to track execution flows separately'. What's the key insight here that should be documented?"
>
> Options: [Summarize the insight] [I'm not sure - please investigate]

### Process

1. Group related questions by area/module
2. Ask 2-3 questions at a time, wait for answers
3. If user says "I'm not sure - please investigate":
   - Read the relevant code, commits, and context yourself
   - Analyze the patterns and behavior
   - Document your findings based on what you discover
4. Move to next area after capturing answers

## Phase 5: Generate and Validate Rules

For each area where you have enough information, create a rule file—but **validate it first**.

### 5A. Rule Validation (Before Writing)

Before generating each rule, verify it passes these tests:

**1. Evidence check**: Does the rule reference actual confusion evidence from commit history?

- If no evidence of confusion, reconsider whether the rule is needed

**2. Code-derivable check**: Read the files the rule will cover. Could the rule's content be determined by reading those files alone?

- If YES → the code is its own documentation — prefer keeping rules for non-derivable insights
- If NO (historical context, edge cases, non-obvious behavior) → rule is valuable

**3. Prevention check**: Would this rule have prevented one of the confusion commits you found?

- If YES → definitely document it
- If NO → reconsider its value

### Rule Quality Examples

**✅ Good rule** (passes all tests):

```markdown
## Path Prefix Matching Must Check Boundaries

When checking if one schema path is a prefix of another using `startsWith()`,
you must verify the match is at a path boundary. Otherwise sibling properties
with similar names incorrectly match.

This caused a bug where `entity` matched `entityCode` (siblings, not parent-child).
```

- Evidence: Learned from actual bug (commit history evidence)
- Not code-derivable: Code doesn't explain why boundary checking matters
- Prevention: Would prevent future prefix-matching bugs

**Compare with a weaker alternative** (fails the checks):

```markdown
## Running Tests

Use `pnpm jest` to run tests. Configuration is in `jest.config.ts`.
```

- No confusion evidence, code-derivable, and wouldn't prevent future mistakes

### 5B. Rule File Guidelines

1. **Location mirrors code structure**
   - Rule for `src/api/` → `.claude/rules/src/api/architecture.md`
   - Rule for testing patterns → `.claude/rules/testing-patterns.md`

2. **Paths must be specific** — use `paths: ['src/api/**/*.ts']` rather than `'**/*.ts'` (too broad wastes context)

3. **Content should explain "why" not just "what"**
   - Focus on the reasoning, history, or gotcha
   - Be concise - every word costs context

4. **Audit dates live in `.claude/codeyam-rule-state.json`** (managed by `codeyam memory touch`). Keep rule frontmatter limited to `paths`.

### Rule Template

```markdown
---
paths:
  - 'specific/path/**/*.ts'
---

## [Clear, Descriptive Title]

[What's the gotcha/insight/non-obvious thing?]

### Why This Matters

[What would go wrong if someone didn't know this?]

### The Solution/Pattern

[What should someone do differently?]
```

---

## Phase 6: Final Review

After generating rules based on your analysis and user answers:

1. **Present a summary** of all rules created

2. **Ask the user:**

   > "I've created rules covering [list areas]. Are there any other areas of the codebase that you know are confusing or have tribal knowledge that I might have missed?"

3. **Generate any additional rules** based on their response

4. **Suggest viewing rules in the dashboard:**

   > "Run `codeyam` to open the dashboard and view all rules in the Rules tab."

5. **Remind the user** to commit the new rules:
   ```
   git add .claude/rules/ .codeyam/rules/
   git commit -m "Add rules for Claude Code (generated via /codeyam:memory)"
   ```

---

## Ongoing Maintenance

### When Claude Should Update Rules

- After fixing a bug that revealed a gotcha
- After making an architectural decision
- When code patterns change
- When asking "why does this work this way?" and learning the answer
- When receiving clarification from the user about any confusion

### Pre-commit Hook Behavior

The pre-commit hook **blocks commits** when:

- Code files matching a rule's `paths` are modified
- The rule's `lastAuditedAt` in `.claude/codeyam-rule-state.json` is older than the code changes

To proceed:

1. Review the flagged rule(s)
2. Update content if needed
3. Run `codeyam memory touch` to mark rules as audited in `.claude/codeyam-rule-state.json`
4. Stage and commit
